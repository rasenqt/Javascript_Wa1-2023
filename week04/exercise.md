# Exercise 5: Q&A HTML+CSS skeleton

Create an prototype of the user interface of the Q&A website, using HTML and CSS.

The website should consist of two web pages:

- A page `index.html` showing a table with the list of all questions (for each question show the title, author, and date). Each question should link to the second page
- A page `answers.html` showing all the answers to the question selected in the previous page. The page should display the information about the question, plus a table containg all the given answers. An example of the answers page is given below:

In this exercise, the web pages must be static (no interactive features), and the reported data will be hard-coded in the HTML source.

Use the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to help styling the layout and the appearance of the page. For compatibility with future libraries, use version `5.2.x` of the library.
